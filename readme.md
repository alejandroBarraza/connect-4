# Connect 4 in React Js

Connect 4 is a two-player strategy game played on a 6x7 grid. Players take turns dropping their colored discs into the grid, with the aim of connecting four of their discs vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The first player to achieve four-in-a-row wins the game. If all the slots in the grid are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
